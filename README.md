1.create a Ml project folder in pc/laptop
2.create Environment in that folder
To create we use python -m venv floder_name
3.Activate the Environment

4.Create backend folder ,frontend folder and Readme.md file
5.In Backend we created load_data folder,train_model folder,requirements.txt, app.py, pick file train_save.py
6.In frontend we created app.py and requirements.txt

#Inside Load_data,we created a file load_data.py and in train_model created a file train_model.py

#After creating the files we created train_save.py and loaded the requirements.txt

#to load libraries we use pip install -r requirements.txt

#after this we run our train_save.py which created pkl file

#Run the app.py

#start another terminal to use the files related to frontend

#Again we have to actiivate the environment

In frontend we created requirements.txt and app.py
before we run we will load the libraries which is required in frontend folder

#after loading the libraried we run the app.py in frontend thrugh streamlit

# to run stream lit we use streamlit run File_name.py

# Push to github

git init
git add backend/frontend/readdme.md
